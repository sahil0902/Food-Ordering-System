# Food Ordering System

This project is a Food Ordering System implemented in C++ that is easy to manage for restaurant management and easy to use for customers. The system allows customers to order food and drinks according to their preferences, enter their address for delivery, and pay the bill using cash or card with receipt generation. The management can easily add, remove, or change the price of food items on the menu. The system design has been laid out using UML diagrams.

## Features

- User-defined functions using classes for efficient task execution
- Storage of food items and prices in arrays for easy management
- Receipt generation using file streaming
- Object-oriented programming to enable communication between classes
- UML diagrams for organization, planning, and visualization of the system
